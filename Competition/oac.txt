What Are the Roadblocks?

Intro Text:
Every transformation brings benefits—and important questions. As we shape the education of the future, we must also face the challenges it creates to make sure learning is fair, safe, and healthy for everyone.

Access for All
New technologies can make learning richer and more personalized, but not everyone has equal access to devices, high-speed internet, or modern classrooms. In many parts of the world, students still struggle with basic resources like textbooks and electricity. Bridging this “digital divide” will be one of the biggest priorities. Governments, communities, and private companies will need to work together to provide affordable tools, training, and support so that no learner is left behind.

Data and Privacy
AI tutors and digital platforms will collect huge amounts of information about how students think, study, and progress. While this data can help personalize education, it can also be misused or stolen if not protected carefully. Questions will arise about who owns this data, how long it is stored, and who has the right to see it. Schools and technology providers will need strong policies to keep student information private and secure, and families will need to understand their rights.

Mental Health
More screen time and constant monitoring can sometimes create stress, anxiety, and burnout. As learning becomes more digital, students may feel pressure to be constantly connected and to perform at their best all the time. To protect mental health, future schools will need to teach healthy habits, encourage balance, and create spaces where students can unplug and connect face-to-face. Supporting emotional well-being will be just as important as teaching academics.
